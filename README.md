# React Shell solution

This solution can be used to spin up a light weight React project

### Main libraries and their usage
* `create-react-app` - foundation React project -- template using typescript
* `testing-library` - foundation testing library that comes with `create-react-app`
* `msw` - mock service worker used for both testing and stubbing out all external calls
* `react-hook-form` - form functionality
* `reduxjs/toolkit` - state management using slices

### Getting started
* `yarn start` - run the project while you are developing
* `yarn test` - run tests in interactive mode
* `yarn build` - builds the app for production to the `build` folder
